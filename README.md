# Morse Code Robot (LEGO Mindstorms Project)

This project demonstrates a LEGO Mindstorms robot capable of reading, decoding, and displaying Morse code. 
Using colour and proximity sensors, the robot interprets input, translates it into Morse code, and presents it through a combination of LCD display and audio output.

## Features

- Translates alphanumeric input into Morse code
- Displays decoded messages on the robot's LCD screen
- Uses audio output to "speak" decoded messages
- Integrates colour and proximity sensors to interpret signals or interact with the environment
- Includes both single and dual sensor line-following capabilities

## Files

- `Morse_Code_Robot_30030295_Mariusz Soltycz.py`: Main logic for Morse code detection, decoding, and multimedia output.
- `Single_follower_GearsBot_30030295.py`: Implements basic line-following behaviour using a single colour sensor.
- `Dual_sensor_follower_GearsBot_30030295.py`: Enhanced line-following functionality with dual sensors for improved path accuracy.

## Technologies

- LEGO Mindstorms EV3
- Python (EV3 MicroPython / ev3dev)
- Colour and proximity sensors
- LCD display and speaker output

## How to Run

1. Upload the Python scripts to your LEGO Mindstorms EV3 brick.
2. Run `Morse_Code_Robot_30030295_Mariusz Soltycz.py` to start Morse code decoding and output.
3. Use the follower scripts to test line-following behaviours with the respective hardware setup.
